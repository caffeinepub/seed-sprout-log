        "Selecting \"All soil types\" shows all entries again.",
        "When the filter is active, the count text (e.g., \"Tracking X seed entries\") reflects the number of entries currently shown (post-filter).",
        "If there are no entries, the existing empty state remains unchanged and no filter is shown (or it is disabled in a sensible way).",
        "All user-facing text related to the filter is in English."

Use existing shadcn-ui primitives already used on the screen (e.g., Card/Button/typography styling conventions) to keep the UI consistent; verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
