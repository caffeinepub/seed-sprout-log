      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "A soil type filter control is visible on the main entries list view (where \"Your Seeds\" and the grid of entry cards are shown).",
        "The filter options are derived from the current set of loaded entries’ soilType values (unique, non-empty), plus an \"All soil types\" option.",
        "Selecting a specific soil type updates the UI to show only entries whose soilType matches the selected value.",
        "Selecting \"All soil types\" shows all entries again.",
        "When the filter is active, the count text (e.g., \"Tracking X seed entries\") reflects the number of entries currently shown (post-filter).",
        "If there are no entries, the existing empty state remains unchanged and no filter is shown (or it is disabled in a sensible way).",
        "All user-facing text related to the filter is in English."
